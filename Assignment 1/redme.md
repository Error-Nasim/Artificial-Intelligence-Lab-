# Lab Assignment 1: Python Name Analyzer

### Problem Statement

This project involves writing a Python function that performs several operations on a given full name. The function is designed to analyze the name by counting vowels and consonants, displaying ASCII values of each character, reversing the name, checking if it's a palindrome, identifying unique letters, and finding the first non-repeating character.

### Technologies Used

- **Python 3**: The primary programming language used to complete this assignment.

### How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository**: If this code is in a Git repository, clone it to your local machine.
2.  **Open the file**: Open the `.py` file in a Python-compatible editor like VS Code or a simple text editor.
3.  **Run from the terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python your_file_name.py
    ```
    _Note: If you encounter an error like "command 'python' not found," try using `python3` instead._

### Sample Inputs and Outputs
